need to do some manually

urgent
    - if checkbox - check
    - shouldn't need max timer
        - crashed on 84 - "cover letter"

find_interesting_jobs.py
    - webscrap linkedin? I guess?
    - find jobs that I find interesting, record to a file, apply for jobs using existing code


    Things I find interesting
        health
            - literal spine prediction
            - coordinating work between doctors
            - medical records
        security
        finance
        climate change
        software application developer (making hotels automated)

Improvements
    Record full questions and answers to file
        - Only recording with the fluff removed at the moment

    record_jobs_applied_for
        - go thru "applied" until we get to "x_date", record to file

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15572288/general-decorator-to-wrap-try-except-in-python

    - 4000+ jobs
        - should start checking job description, don't need to be applying for all of these
        - only apply for job if "python" is in the description

    if 'scroll_bar' present in page
        - scroll to bottom

    limitations
        cannot apply for jobs when there is lots of questions and we need to scroll down


    question fluff
        - Need to check for word boundaries, python getting reduced to "pyth"
        - should also record the raw questions so they're easier to understand. Wait does that make sense?
        - Well yeah, so we record 1 raw question, then remove the fluff, compare the questions if they match, no need to
         compare the next one

    Record 'jobs_applied to' info to a file so I can search for the company and position
        - record company, job title, url, date

    Some questions getting recorded are absolute gibberish, not sure why
    If question is longer than 100 chars - print to screen along with url and other shit

    - Don't record questions that have non ascii characters
    - Set a 5 second timeout for each page. i.e., try filling each one out for 5 seconds
        - May be able to remove the timer at this point


    Questions and answers
        - Need to start making question and answer rules
        - if salary in question, answer 120000
            - if also hourly in question answer 62

"no matching jobs found"
    - need to just start clicking the next one in the "jobs you may be interested in" category
    apply for job all of them, then refresh the page
            # Get sidebar, can use to look for mor jobs after we run out of results
            #   Or could just do it this way in the first place
            # sidebar = driver.find_element('xpath',"//ul[@class='scaffold-layout__list-container']")
            # lis = sidebar.find_elements('xpath',".//li")
            # li_first = lis[0]
            # job_title = li_first.text.split('\n')[0]



Improvements - from old - not sure if valid anymore
    - Record text of radio button and answer yes no appropriately
    - Be able to select drop down
    - Record open text box questions, and answers
    - may need seperate file for them
