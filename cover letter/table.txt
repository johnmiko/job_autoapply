mechanical engineer: I worked as a mechanical engineer at Probe from 2017-2019 where I designed down-hole logging tools using SolidWorks, this included creating drawings, doing FEA and renderings. The workload was so high that I wrote several VBA macros to automate repetitive design tasks. I reduced my workload/design speed by about 25% by doing this. At this position I had to have a solid understanding of various manufacturing processes, and material properties to select the correct material, design, and manufacturer for each part. I designed tests of critical parts to ensure they would not fail when deployed. For example, after designing springs by varying the material property, and dimensions to get the best spring constant, I would partially assemble a centralizer with the new springs and attach a force measurement device. The force measurement device would be manually closed on the centralizer and I would record the movement of the centralizer and the force measured to see how close it was to the theoretical results and check that it was manufactured correctly. Several times I had to change the design of a tool after troubleshooting why the ground path for the electricity wasnâ€™t working. Often times it would turn out to be that two parts would be separated by a couple thousandths of an inch, so a small spring would need to be inserted, or the material of a screw was non-conductive. 
self motivate: The best example of my self motivation is that make my income as a self-employed stock trader. To do this, I had to take the risk of quitting my full-time job, watching lectures and reading books about the stock market in my free time to understand what I needed to do.
