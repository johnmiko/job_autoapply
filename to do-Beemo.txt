    answering questions better
        - have exact answers
            - if answer exists in text file
            - can question have exact answer? example - salary should not have an exact answer
                - answer based on job, so job specific questions
        - in cover letter, have a more generic system
            - check for exact match, if not exact match, then check generics?
            - have criterias?
            - can probably just create functions, can't really be asked THAT many questions
