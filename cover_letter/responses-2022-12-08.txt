"I have 3 years of experience working with cloud computing platforms including AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. While working at R3mote.io, I was responsible for maintaining the Azure cloud resources, this included modifying the CI/CD pipeline, editing the docker images, and adjusting the load balancing when necessary.",'["continuous integration"]',
"During university I was a part of the Autonomous Robot Club. The purpose of the club was to develop a robot to compete in the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition, navigating an obstacle course autonomously. One project I worked on was calibrating the robots video camera with its LIDAR data. To do this I built an upside-down table and painted each of the 4 legs with neon bright colours. I then used K-means clustering to find the position of each leg in the camera image and matching this to the position of the legs shown by the LIDAR.",'["autonomous vehicles"]',
"When working, I always take detailed notes on how things work, or the steps required to complete a task. Because of this, it's very easy for me to turn these notes into clear documentation for everyone to use.","['write clear','documentation']",

"I have worked with Python now for 8 years. During this time I have worked with teams ranging from large companies, to being self-employed. I have used libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTest, Nose, Selenium, Django, and FastApi. I have built RESTful API’s and integrated 3rd party ones. I spent 3 years creating a hockey betting algorithm in Python. To do this I watched 30 hours of lectures on machine learning, scrapped all advanced hockey statistics since the 1950’s from the web, and trained various algorithms on this dataset.",'["Please describe your experience with Python"]',
