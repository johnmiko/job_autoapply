Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Backend Python Developer position at LanceSoft. As a developer with 8 years of programming experience and an altruistic nature, I find the responsibilities of this job posting enjoyable and straightforward.
Dear Hiring Manager,
In terms of raw experience, I have 8 years of experience with Python, 3 using continuous integration, 3 with SQL 3, and 1 using Linux.
When working, I always take detailed notes on how things work, or the steps required to complete a task. Because of this, it's very easy for me to turn these notes into clear documentation for everyone to use.
Personally, I really enjoy putting the finishing touches on things. This personality trait lets me enjoy reviewing pull requests more than others.
Besides my previous experience, I believe my optimism and hardworking nature are qualities that will make a positive contribution to LanceSoft. Here is my calendly link (https://calendly.com/johnmiko/meeting) of when Iâ€™m available for an interview, or you can send me an email at johnmiko4@gmail.com. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.

Sincerely,

John Miko
