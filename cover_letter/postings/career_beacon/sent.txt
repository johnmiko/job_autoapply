Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Python Developer position at Career Beacon. As a developer with 8 years of programming experience, I find the responsibilities of this job posting enjoyable and straightforward.
In terms of raw experience, I have 8 years with Python, 3 with agile, 3 with SQL, 2 with Java, 2 with Docker, and 2 with JavaScript.
In my personal life I enjoy taking up difficult hobbies. Because of this, I can comfortably work under pressure as work is always less stressful than my personal life.
I have 2 younger sisters that are mentally disabled. Growing up with them ingrained into me the concept of being a team player. Because of this, it's normal for me to volunteer to do the work that no one else wants to at a job. It has also made me very patient and understanding.
Besides my previous experience, I believe my optimism and hardworking nature are qualities that will make a positive contribution to Career Beacon. Here is my calendly link (https://calendly.com/johnmiko/meeting) of when I'm available for an interview, or you can send me an email at johnmiko4@gmail.com. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.

Sincerely,

John Miko
